# Chat

This is the networking project from the academy.

This is a simple chat program built on TcpClient basis

It has such features as private messages (double click on contact name), smiles and file transfer (right click on contact name to send and left click on the message to download). The last one is done in a hurry so it is not as it should be, however it works
